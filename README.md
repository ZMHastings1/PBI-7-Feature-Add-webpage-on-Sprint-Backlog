# PBI-7-Feature-Add-webpage-on-Sprint-Backlog
Issue Description: 
As a Scrum newbie visiting this website, I want to learn about the difference between a Spring backlog and a Product Backlog so I can help plan both during our Scrum meetings.  

Task Details: 
Create a web page that answers the question. What is the difference between a Sprint backlog and a Product Backlog?
Use template.html as a template for consistency across pages. Name the page sprintbacklog.html
All filenames should be lowercase, no spaces or special characters. 
Code a H1 that states the question.
Use AI to write the content. Add about two or three paragraphs worth of content. Give examples of the topic if appropriate. 
Add one image that relates to the topic from https://innolution.com/resources/visual-agilexicon  
Put the image in the \images\ folder and use lowercase, no spaces for the filename.
Cite the image source after the last paragraph with “The Visual AGILExicon® is a trademark of Innolution, LLC and Kenneth S. Rubin. The Visual AGILExicon is used and described in the book: Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process. You can learn more about the Visual AGILExicon and permitted uses at: http://innolution.com/resources/val-home-page” 
The website needs to be functional but does not have to be perfect. Don’t spend hours perfecting the html. Keep it simple. The learning objective is to practice Scrum processes using GitHub issues, branches, and pull requests.
